This is a readme file for the MATLAB implementation of the algorithm in "Image reconstruction from a bag of image patches"

There are two important files in this tar file:
jigsawSolver_withEstEvidence.m
jigsawSolver_withoutEstEvidence.m

jigsawSolver_withEstEvidence.m solves the jigsaw puzzle with the estimated low resolution image (see the paper for algorithmic details)

jigsawSolver_withoutEstEvidence.m solves the jigsaw puzzle without the estimated low resolution image.  

These scripts are commented so they should be self-explanatory.

The code has been tested on MATLAB 7.6.0.324 (R2008a) on a Unix machine, but should be portable to other platforms as well.
